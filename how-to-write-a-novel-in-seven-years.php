    <p>The idea will fall into your head one day. Maybe you are out getting a snack. Maybe you are talking with a friend or lover. Maybe you are washing the dishes. But the idea comes to you the way a dewdrop comes to the ground. It hangs overhead, just at the edge of thought, for a very long time, and then suddenly is soil, the first nourishment for what will soon sprout from your head.</p>
    <p>A flower that no one will ever have seen before. A bloom that you will be the first to name. You must tend to it. You must take every chance to give it care.</p>

    <p>You click.</p>
    <p>And you click.</p>
    <p>And you click.</p>
    <p>And you click.</p>
