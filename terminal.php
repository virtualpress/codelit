    <p>Why do the doctors call it that? Maybe</p>
    <p>it's literal: a waiting room prior to departure.</p>
    <p>If so, the terminal must be opulent:</p>
    <p>cathedral ceilinged and brass clocked,</p>
    <p>the trains coming swift, the windows</p>
    <p>vibrating almost melodically. Even the benches</p>
    <p>are swept clean. The terminal smells like a theory.</p>
    <p>It is evening. It is morning.</p>
    <p>A train whistles, but that is not your train.</p>
