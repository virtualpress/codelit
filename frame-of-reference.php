    <p><span class="lit">Breakfasts were fraught.</span> <span class="lit">A brand of eggs we'd never bought had been recalled.</span> <span class="lit">Roommates in a house older than ours had perished from a gas leak that the city hadn't cared to fix, and would we like a voice-controlled smoke and CO detector at a special, one-time rate?</span> <span class="lit">That was just what we read before we logged on for work.</span> <span class="lit">We described the small blows of our days as "apocalyptic."</span> <span class="lit">We moved through tall grass, itching everywhere.</span> <span class="lit">Every minute of every hour pinged in our pockets, a drill sergeant spitting in our ears, but softly.</span> <span class="lit">Life was the same for us as it was for everyone, we lied to ourselves.</span> <span class="lit">We did not know everyone.</span> <span class="lit">We hardly knew one another.</span> <span class="lit">We held little desire to know anything, but what we did not know caused us diarrhea.</span> <span class="lit">(And we all shared a bathroom.)</span> <span class="lit">We were not happy, but we were not unhappy, either.</span> <span class="lit">We were missing...</span> <span class="lit">something.</span> <span class="lit">We felt this lack more acutely than we ever had, even in the days when we had nothing.</span> <span class="lit">Nothing!</span> <span class="lit">We needed to go back there.</span> <span class="lit">So Carlos ordered some weighted blankets.</span> <span class="lit">Priya set up looping white noise playlists.</span> <span class="lit">Adedayo replaced our mothy curtains with blackout ones.</span> <span class="lit">Dexter angled our mirrors so we could brush our teeth and not see ourselves.</span> <span class="lit">We stripped our rooms bare and posted videos of them.</span> <span class="lit">We pitched in for 500 pounds of salt to fill the one bathtub in our one bathroom.</span> <span class="lit">For a day we took turns floating without acknowledging each other, our legs forced over the tub's edge, making puddles we couldn't see in the dark.</span> <span class="lit">This helped, at first.</span> <span class="lit">But then the Chinese restaurant where Justine worked closed.</span> <span class="lit">"Look at me," she told us.</span> <span class="lit">"Now I really got nothing."</span> <span class="lit">After we finished the final leftover red braised pork that Justine would ever bring back for us, we were stuck with her nothing.</span> <span class="lit">(Namely her inability to pay her share of rent.)</span> <span class="lit">When Bart suggested that the rest of us follow her lead, to <i>voluntarily</i> stop showing up at our jobs, even those of us working remotely laughed in his face.</span> <span class="lit">We wanted to experience nothing, sure, but first we had to afford it.</span> <span class="lit">"Are we committed to this transformation or what?" Bart asked.</span> <span class="lit">(We had to admit that we were not.)</span> <span class="lit">The problem, Bart went on, was that everything we'd done thus far was a half-measure.</span> <span class="lit">Posting a video that depicted nothing still took up space &mdash; took up more space, in fact, made that <i>nothing</i> an undeniable <i>something</i>.</span> <span class="lit">"We can't just simulate the feeling of absence," Bart said.</span> <span class="lit">"We have to become &mdash; quite literally &mdash; nothing."</span> <span class="lit">"This is starting to sound cult-ish," Adedayo said.</span> <span class="lit">"Bart isn't charming enough to lead a cult," Priya said.</span> <span class="lit">"I'm not proposing we <i>kill</i> ourselves," Bart said.</span> <span class="lit">"So what?" said Dexter.</span> <span class="lit">"We just wake up one day, dead?"</span> <span class="lit">"Not dead."</span> <span class="lit">Bart gestured, as if to cue the violins.</span> <span class="lit">"We find a way to exist in a perpetual state of <i>not living</i>.</span> <span class="lit">Invisible as air, but more so.</span> <span class="lit">Air carries particles.</span> <span class="lit">Viruses.</span> <span class="lit">Instead, we reach a state in which we carry nothing.</span> <span class="lit">Because we've <i>become</i> nothing.</span> <span class="lit">What if we created a plane of existence in which we did not have to exist?"</span> <span class="lit">"Who ate the last piece of pork?" said Carlos, and we all looked away.</span> <span class="lit">And yet, in the following weeks, Bart's idea took shape in us, began to feel solid, then heavy &mdash; a kidney stone the size of a baby, whose weight we could lessen only by considering it.</span> <span class="lit">He whined about us staying at our jobs, but there we could study our bosses, how they were able to perceive our living, breathing selves as nothing.</span> <span class="lit">The trick was to lose ourselves in those perceptions.</span> <span class="lit">That plus harder drugs, maybe religion.</span> <span class="lit">A religion that uses a lot of drugs.</span> <span class="lit">To look away from one another in a house that had been emptied of all but its walls was not enough.</span> <span class="lit">We put on thick blindfolds.</span> <span class="lit">And industrial earplugs.</span> <span class="lit">Bart made an unsavory joke about Helen Keller, and though we could no longer perceive him, we knew because he was Bart.</span> <span class="lit">After a few months, we had all either lost our jobs, or our desire to go to our jobs, or in Bart's case maybe not had a job to begin with.</span> <span class="lit">(We were never quite sure.)</span> <span class="lit">Soon we were blazed and relieved of every sense with our padded clothes and numbing cream and our taste and smell gone to the virus we'd all somehow contracted.</span> <span class="lit">On one of those nights, Carlos and Justine engaged in what Carlos described as the ghostliest sex of his life.</span> <span class="lit">"It was like it wasn't even happening," Carlos said to us the next morning, during our house meeting.</span> <span class="lit">(We'd taken off our blindfolds and earplugs for the moment, to discuss our landlord's latest ominous letter.)</span> <span class="lit">"What did I even <i>say</i> to you last night, Justine?"</span> <span class="lit">"Uh, that wasn't me," said Justine.</span> <span class="lit">"<i>Focus</i>, guys," said Bart.</span> <span class="lit">"How are we going to keep the house?"</span> <span class="lit">"I don't think this experiment is working," Adedayo said.</span> <span class="lit">"Yeah," said Priya.</span> <span class="lit">"I'm still...</span> <span class="lit">here."</span> <span class="lit">In the dark, we made out what could be Priya's outstretched hand.</span> <span class="lit">Dexter peeled off a strip of blackout tape from a window, and through the daze of light, fingers emerged.</span> <span class="lit">Little flabs of skin hung off the knuckles.</span> <span class="lit">The pinky quivered.</span> <span class="lit">The presence of the hand made us aware of the presence of air.</span> <span class="lit">We had to breathe it, to move through it.</span> <span class="lit">The floorboards warped and sagged below us.</span> <span class="lit">The walls appeared to sweat.</span> <span class="lit">Who were we in this place?</span> <span class="lit">Not white, for one.</span> <span class="lit">Not straight.</span> <span class="lit">Not rich.</span> <span class="lit">Not great.</span> <span class="lit">And now as we'd molded the world into one that did not include us, we'd become a...</span> <span class="lit"><i>not something</i>.</span> <span class="lit">Which was a true crisis, because a <i>not something</i> was not a <i>nothing</i>.</span> <span class="lit">It was worse: it was this <i>hand</i>, floating in space.</span> <span class="lit">Priya stared at it and screamed.</span> <span class="lit">We had to make changes.</span> <span class="lit">We laid off the drugs and fake religions.</span> <span class="lit">We did pushups and ate fruits and veggies and oats.</span> <span class="lit">We were lucky, we told ourselves.</span> <span class="lit">We were so very lucky.</span> <span class="lit">And then Bart gave in and called his parents and they took care of all of our late payments, and we realized that that fucker was the luckiest of us all.</span> <span class="lit">Why did he even live with us?</span> <span class="lit">When we asked him, all he said was, "Can you imagine being alone, <i>now</i>?"</span> <span class="lit">Eventually, Bart got us better jobs.</span> <span class="lit">A cousin's start-up.</span> <span class="lit">An uncle's real estate company disguised as a non-profit.</span> <span class="lit">The frames we'd torn off the walls, and the furniture we'd thrown out, and the bread and beer we'd tossed from the fridge, along with the fridge &mdash; he bought it all back and more.</span> <span class="lit">Some nights, we lay on the floor, hand in hand, surrounded by everything we'd ever had.</span> <span class="lit">Our phones again.</span> <span class="lit">Our VR headsets, workout bikes, streaming subscriptions, and, with our own money, a home float tank big enough for our legs.</span> <span class="lit">We used them all.</span> <span class="lit">We used them not at all.</span> <span class="lit">It didn't matter.</span> <span class="lit">They were there to tell us who we were.</span></p>
