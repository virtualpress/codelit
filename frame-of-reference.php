was a half-measure.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(33)" onmouseenter="y(33)" onmouseleave="z(33)">Posting a video that depicted nothing still took up space &mdash; took up more space, in fact,

so.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(46)" onmouseenter="y(46)" onmouseleave="z(46)">Air carries particles.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(47)" onmouseenter="y(47)"

looked away.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(52)" onmouseenter="y(52)" onmouseleave="z(52)">And yet, in the following weeks, Bart's idea took shape in us, began to feel solid, then heavy &mdash; a kidney stone the size of a baby, whose weight we could lessen only by considering it.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(53)" onmouseenter="y(53)" onmouseleave="z(53)">He whined about us staying at our jobs, but there we could study our bosses, how they were able to perceive our living, breathing selves as nothing.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(54)" onmouseenter="y(54)" onmouseleave="z(54)">The trick was to lose ourselves in those perceptions.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(55)" onmouseenter="y(55)" onmouseleave="z(55)">That plus harder drugs, maybe religion.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(56)" onmouseenter="y(56)" onmouseleave="z(56)">A religion that uses a lot of drugs.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(57)" onmouseenter="y(57)"

onmouseleave="z(58)">We put on thick blindfolds.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(59)" onmouseenter="y(59)" onmouseleave="z(59)">And industrial earplugs.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(60)" onmouseenter="y(60)" onmouseleave="z(60)">Bart made an unsavory joke about Helen Keller, and though we could no longer perceive him, we knew because he was Bart.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(61)" onmouseenter="y(61)" onmouseleave="z(61)">After a few months, we had all either lost our jobs, or our desire to go to our jobs, or in Bart's case maybe not had a job to begin with.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(62)" onmouseenter="y(62)" onmouseleave="z(62)">(We were never quite sure.)</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(63)" onmouseenter="y(63)" onmouseleave="z(63)">Soon we were blazed and relieved of every sense with our padded clothes and numbing cream and our taste and smell gone to the virus we'd all somehow contracted.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(64)" onmouseenter="y(64)" onmouseleave="z(64)">On one of those nights, Carlos and Justine engaged in what Carlos described as the ghostliest sex of his life.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(65)" onmouseenter="y(65)" onmouseleave="z(65)">"It was like it wasn't even happening," Carlos said to us the next morning, during our house meeting.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(66)" onmouseenter="y(66)" onmouseleave="z(66)">We'd taken off our blindfolds and earplugs for the moment, to discuss our landlord's latest ominous letter.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(67)" onmouseenter="y(67)" onmouseleave="z(67)">"What did I even <i>say</i> to you last night, Justine?"</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(68)" onmouseenter="y(68)" onmouseleave="z(68)">"Uh, that wasn't me," said Justine.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(69)" onmouseenter="y(69)" onmouseleave="z(69)">"<i>Focus</i>, guys," said Bart.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(70)" onmouseenter="y(70)" onmouseleave="z(70)">"How are we going to keep the house?"</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(71)" onmouseenter="y(71)" onmouseleave="z(71)">"I don't think this experiment is working," Adedayo said.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(72)" onmouseenter="y(72)" onmouseleave="z(72)">"Yeah," said Priya.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(73)" onmouseenter="y(73)" onmouseleave="z(73)">"I'm still...</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(74)" onmouseenter="y(74)" onmouseleave="z(74)">here."</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(75)" onmouseenter="y(75)" onmouseleave="z(75)">In the dark, we made out what could be Priya's outstretched hand.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(76)" onmouseenter="y(76)" onmouseleave="z(76)">Dexter peeled off a strip of blackout tape from a window, and through the daze of light, fingers emerged.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(77)" onmouseenter="y(77)" onmouseleave="z(77)">Little flabs of skin hung off the knuckles.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(78)" onmouseenter="y(78)" onmouseleave="z(78)">The pinky quivered.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(79)" onmouseenter="y(79)" onmouseleave="z(79)">The presence of the hand made us aware of the presence of air.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(80)" onmouseenter="y(80)" onmouseleave="z(80)">We had to breathe it, to move through it.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(81)" onmouseenter="y(81)" onmouseleave="z(81)">The floorboards warped and sagged below us.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(82)" onmouseenter="y(82)" onmouseleave="z(82)">The walls appeared to sweat.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(83)" onmouseenter="y(83)" onmouseleave="z(83)">Who were we in this place?</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(84)" onmouseenter="y(84)" onmouseleave="z(84)">Not white, for one.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(85)" onmouseenter="y(85)" onmouseleave="z(85)">Not straight.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(86)" onmouseenter="y(86)" onmouseleave="z(86)">Not rich.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(87)" onmouseenter="y(87)" onmouseleave="z(87)">Not great.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(88)" onmouseenter="y(88)" onmouseleave="z(88)">And now as we'd molded the world into one that did not include us, we'd become a...</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(89)" onmouseenter="y(89)" onmouseleave="z(89)"><i>not something</i>.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(90)" onmouseenter="y(90)" onmouseleave="z(90)">Which was a true crisis, because a <i>not something</i> was not a <i>nothing</i>.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(91)" onmouseenter="y(91)" onmouseleave="z(91)">It was worse: it was this <i>hand</i>, floating in space.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(92)" onmouseenter="y(92)" onmouseleave="z(92)">Priya stared at it and screamed.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(93)" onmouseenter="y(93)" onmouseleave="z(93)">We had to make changes.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(94)" onmouseenter="y(94)" onmouseleave="z(94)">We laid off the drugs and fake religions.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(95)" onmouseenter="y(95)" onmouseleave="z(95)">We did pushups and ate fruits and veggies and oats.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(96)" onmouseenter="y(96)" onmouseleave="z(96)">We were lucky, we told ourselves.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(97)" onmouseenter="y(97)" onmouseleave="z(97)">We were so very lucky.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(98)" onmouseenter="y(98)" onmouseleave="z(98)">And then Bart gave in and called his parents and they took care of all of our late payments, and we realized that that fucker was the luckiest of us all.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(99)" onmouseenter="y(99)" onmouseleave="z(99)">Why did he even live with us?</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(100)" onmouseenter="y(100)" onmouseleave="z(100)">When we asked him, all he said was, "Can you imagine being alone, <i>now</i>?"</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(101)" onmouseenter="y(101)" onmouseleave="z(101)">Eventually, Bart got us better jobs.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(102)" onmouseenter="y(102)" onmouseleave="z(102)">A cousin's start-up.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(103)" onmouseenter="y(103)" onmouseleave="z(103)">An uncle's real estate company disguised as a non-profit.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(104)" onmouseenter="y(104)" onmouseleave="z(104)">The frames we'd torn off the walls, and the furniture we'd thrown out, and the bread and beer we'd tossed from the fridge, along with the fridge &mdash; he bought it all back and more.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(105)" onmouseenter="y(105)" onmouseleave="z(105)">Some nights, we lay on the floor, hand in hand, surrounded by everything we'd ever had.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(106)" onmouseenter="y(106)" onmouseleave="z(106)">Our phones again.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(107)" onmouseenter="y(107)" onmouseleave="z(107)">Our VR headsets, workout bikes, streaming subscriptions, and, with our own money, a home float tank big enough for our legs.</span> <span

all.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(110)" onmouseenter="y(110)" onmouseleave="z(110)">It didn't matter.</span> <span class="lit" onclick="x(111)" onmouseenter="y(111)" onmouseleave="z(111)">They
