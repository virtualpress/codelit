   <div class="content">
    <p class="lit">I have three stone peaches<br>the color of pink pearls<br>in the light of a July morning.</p>
    <p class="lit">Each peach the weight<br>of a kitten. The feeling<br>of a pill's rising makes me turn</p>
    <p class="lit">to the window. I hold<br>the stones. The sky is striped<br>in bands of blue, orange cream.</p>
    <p class="lit">When did evening arrive?<br>I had gone to the beach?<br>And when I stepped inside</p>
    <p class="lit">there was a large insect<br>moving across the floor.<br>Dark, dull blade of shadow.</p>
    <p class="lit">I couldn't spare it. I haven't<br>written a word for months.<br>Not one. Fruit on her</p>
    <p class="lit">kitchen counter? There is none.<br>Not even rotting. No peaches,<br>no stone. Neighbors took the cats.</p>
    <p class="lit">The rooms won't stay emptied<br>but I won't know how.<br>How long. How many</p>
    <p class="lit">pairs of shoes I counted<br>cleaning out the closets<br>I will soon have forgotten.</p>
